# vaccination-tracker
A personal project for tracking &amp; predicting Covid-19 vaccination rates in Germany.

Originally written in early 2021, this project's goal was to try to predict when each wave of Covid-19 vaccinations would be complete in Germany, and the approximate dates when vaccination would be opened up for each priority group.
