# vaccination-tracker
A personal project for tracking &amp; predicting Covid-19 vaccination rates in Germany.

Originally written in early 2021, when Germany had established a priority group system for eligibility to receive one of the country's limited supply of Covid-19 vaccinations. This project's goal was to try to predict when each wave of vaccinations would be complete, and the approximate dates when vaccination would be opened up for each subsequent priority group.
